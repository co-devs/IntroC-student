Answering the following questions earns 2 flags (6pts) and there is a 3rd flag for the fill-in-the-blank at the bottom.

In your own words, describe the following decision making statements:
	if statement
        if the condition is met then execute the following commands
	if...else statement
        if the condition is met then execute the following commands
        otherwise, execute the following commands
	nested if statement
        if the condition is met then execute the following commands
        inside that if, another conditional which, if met, execute its commands
	switch statement
        based on the value of the given expression, execute the code following the matchin value
	nested switch statement
        same as switch but with another one inside it
In your own words, describe the following loop types:
	while loop
        while a condition is met, execute the code block
	for loop
        for the given values, execute the code block
	do...while loop
        execute a code block, then while a condition remains true, repeat
	nested loops
        loops that occur inside of loops. The nested loop occurs for each iteration of the container loop
In your own words, describe the following control statements:
	break statement
        Terminate the containing loop or switch
	continue statement
        Similar to break, but instead of terminating, it moves on to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any code in between
	goto statement
        1 way transfer of control to another line of code
There are two things wrong with this code. Find the deficiencies and fix the code.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    for (;;)
    {
        int i = 0;
        // this is an infinite loop, i never iterates and there is no escape condition
	while(1)
	{
	    i++;
        // infinite loop. the conditional is 1, which never changes. i can iterate as much as it wants to but it has no impact on the continuation of the loop
        }
    }
    return i;
 }

For an additional flag, complete the following statement by filling in the blanks(the above code is a clue):
 	"You can terminate a/an (blank) (blank) by pressing (blank) + (blank) keys"
    "You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing te ctrl + c keys"

To submit your answer, SHA1 hash the final answer. (Ex: if the four blanks above are dog, cat, mouse and fly in that order, you would SHA1 hash "dog,cat,mouse,fly" (without quotes and all lower case)) Submit the hash to the CTF server for points. infinite,loop,ctrl,c - (405d98bfa02f0e70bdfa13f99f5be4dbb3e12695)
