Answering these questions earns you 1 flag (3pts) and there is a second flag available for writing a short program.

What are pointers?
    A pointer is a variable which contains the address in memory of another variable.
What is the purpose of using pointers?
    Some tasks in C are easier to accomplish with pointers, and some, like dynamic memory allocation, cannot be completed without pointers.
Explain how to use pointers?
    1. Define pointer variable
        int *ip;
    2. Assign address of a variable to a pointer
        ip = &var;
    3. Access the value at the address available in the pointer variable
        printf(*ip);

In regards to pointers, is it good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable? Why/why not?
    Yes. Whenever an exact address is not assigned/in use. To prevent accidentally corrupting data at that address.

What does dereferencing mean?
Using the * operatorto access the value of the data stored at the pointer's address

Write a program that will declare type int with the name "num" and assign it the value 10. The program must have 2 printf statements. The first statement will print the value of the int, and the second statement will print the address of the data stored in memory.

#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
    int num = 10;
    printf("%d", num);
    printf("%x", &num);
    return 0;
}
