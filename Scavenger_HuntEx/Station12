Answering these questions earns a flag and witing the program described below earns another flag.

Define the following words:
	Input
		Data feed into program
	Ouput
		Data fee from program
	stdin
		Standard input, from keyboard
	stdout
		Standard output, to screen
	stderr
		Standard error, output caused by errors, to screen
	buffer
		Temporary storage area, all stdin stdout flows through

What does the scanf() do?
	reads formatted input from stdin. Can use to assign input to a variable

List other functions similar to scanf().
	gets(), fgets()

Write a program that does the following:
	Allocate a buffer by calling to malloc
	+ Create a new file
	+ Write something into the file
	+ Close the opened file
	+ Open a file for read
	Free the allocated buffer
	Allocate a buffer by calling to malloc
	Read the file content into the new buffer
	+ Close the file
	Print the buffer content
	Free the buffer
Use the following questions to help you write the program:
	What is the function to create a new file or open an existing file?
	What is the function to write to a file?
	What is the function to close a file?
	What is the function to read a file?
	What is the purpose of the function malloc()?
	What is the purpose of the function free()?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
	// allocate buffer using malloc

	// open file test.txt
	FILE *fp = fopen("output/test.txt", "a+");
	//write to file
	fprintf(fp, "This is text...\n");
	// close file when done
	int fclose( FILE *fp );

	// open file test.txt for read
	// FILE *fp = fopen("output/test.txt", "r");
	// free the allocated buffer

	// allocate a buffer using malloc

	// read the file content into the new buffer

	// close file when done
	// int fclose( FILE *fp );
	// print the buffer content

	// free the buffer

}

To submit your answer, show the working program to the instructor. The instructor will provide you with the SHA1 hash. Submit the hash to the CTF server for points.
