	buffer

What does the scanf() do? 

List other functions similar to scanf().

Write a program that does the following:
	Allocate a buffer by calling to malloc
	Create a new file
	Write something into the file
	Close the opened file
	Open a file for read
	Free the allocated buffer
	Allocate a buffer by calling to malloc
	Read the file content into the new buffer
	Close the file
	Print the buffer content
	Free the buffer
Use the following questions to help you write the program:
	What is the function to create a new file or open an existing file?
	What is the function to write to a file?
	What is the function to close a file?
	What is the function to read a file?
	What is the purpose of the function malloc()?
	What is the purpose of the function free()?

To submit your answer, show the working program to the instructor. The instructor will provide you with the SHA1 hash. Submit the hash to the CTF server for points.
