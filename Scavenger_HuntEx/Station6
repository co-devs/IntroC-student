What are the differences between single and multi dimensional arrays?

How many elements do the following arrays contain?

int main ()
{
    char str1[12] = "Hello";
    char str2[12] = "World";
    int  len;
    strcat(str1, str2);
    len = strlen(str1);
    printf("%s", str1 );
    printf("%d", len );
    return 0;
}
