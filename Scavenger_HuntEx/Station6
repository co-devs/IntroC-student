Answering these questions will earn you 2 flags (6pts) and there's a third flag available below for determining the output of the code.

What are data structures?
    A way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently

What are arrays?
    A number of elements in a specific order, typically of the same type

What are the differences between single and multi dimensional arrays?
    In single arrays, each value of the array is of the desired type, like an integer. In multi dimensional arrays, there are n number of nested arrays with the lowest level containing the desired type, like int.
        e.g. {1,2,3,4} vs {{1,2},{1,2},{1,2}}

How many elements do the following arrays contain?
	double balance[1000];
        1000
	int balance[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        5
	int balance[] = {5,4,3};
        3

The first element in an array starts with what index number?
    0

True/False? Explain why. "Strings are one-dimensional array of characters"
    Generally, true. Strings consist of a number of elements, in this case of the same type, in a specific order, which is the definition of an array.

What character are strings terminated by?
    NULL

What are the following functions' purpose?
	strcpy()
        Copies the string pointed to, by src to dest
	strcat()
        Appends the string pointed to by src to the end of the string pointed to by dest
	strlen()
        Computes the length of the string up to but not including terminating NULL
	strcmp()
        Compares the string pointed to by str1 to the string pointed to by str2
	strchr()
        Searches for the first occurence of the character c in the string pointed to by the argument str
	strstr()
        Finds the first occurence of the substring needle in the string haystack

For another flag, what is the output of the following code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
    char str1[12] = "Hello"; // l
    char str2[12] = "World"; // r
    int  len;
    strcat(str1, str2); // HelloWorld
    len = strlen(str1); // 10
    printf("%s", str1 ); // HelloWorld
    printf("%d", len ); // 10
    return 0;
}
