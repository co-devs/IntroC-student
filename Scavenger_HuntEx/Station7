The following program should output C:\Windows\system32\temp\'evil.txt'
How can you fix the prinf statement to have the proper output?

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("C:\Windows\system32\temp\evil.txt");
    return 0;
} 	

To submit your answer, SHA1 hash the final answer. The final answer should include everything between the double quotes within the printf statement. (Ex. if printf("LOL''WHAT"); is the correct format, your answer should be "LOL''WHAT" (without the double quotes)) Submit the hash to the CTF server for points.
